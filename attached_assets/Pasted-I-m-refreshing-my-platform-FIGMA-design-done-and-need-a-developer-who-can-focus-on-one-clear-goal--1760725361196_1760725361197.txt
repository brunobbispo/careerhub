I’m refreshing my platform (FIGMA design done) and need a developer who can focus on one clear goal: an events-driven careers hub where visitors can discover, register for, and stay informed about career-related events.

Scope of work
• Build a dedicated Events Listing page that:
– Displays upcoming career events in an attractive grid/list.
– Lets users filter events by category (e.g., workshops, webinars, fairs).
– Supports free or paid tickets with a smooth checkout flow for paid options.
– Allows organisers (me) to upload media—images, videos, PDFs—per event.
– Enables visitor registration and automatically triggers confirmation emails plus future announcements or reminders.

• Add a “Book a Career Coach” section that integrates a scheduling tool (Calendly, Acuity, or similar) so users can reserve and pay for sessions without leaving the site or just directing to a third party site.

• Embed my proprietary assessment tool (already built) directly into the site, storing the results in the same user profile used for event sign-ups and coaching bookings.

• Admin dashboard essentials: create/edit events, set price tiers, view registrations, manage media, and export attendee data.

• Mobile-first, accessible design with clear CTAs and a frictionless sign-up experience. No job-search or job-application modules are required; those features have been removed.

Tech stack
I’m comfortable with popular frameworks—React/Next.js, Laravel, or WordPress + custom plugin—so propose the stack you’re fastest with, noting any payment gateways or notification services you prefer (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Twilio, Firebase).

Delivery
I expect a working, deployed module with clean, well-documented code, basic test coverage, and a walkthrough on how to use the admin panel. Phase-two enhancements are possible once this core is live, so build with extensibility in mind.

If you’ve launched similar event or booking portals, I’d love to see your demo links in your bid.
